# synchronized-vega-lite

Convert Vega-Lite specifications into collaborative visualizations.

This package contains three modules:

## svl-client

This package processes and enhances Vega-Lite specifications so that they can communicate with a server and draw cursors representing remote interactions on the visualization.

## svl-server

This package enhances a simple Node.js server with base functionality to handle communication from SVL clients.

## svl-dev-server

This package provides a development environment for designers to test out their collaborative visualization specifications. It also presents an example of how to include `svl-client` and `svl-server` in a project.

> To quickly get started with the system, go to the development server directory, and follow the readme there!
