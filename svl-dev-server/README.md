# svl-dev-server

## Get Started

The latest version of the development server should be live at svl-dev.herokuapp.com. If you wish to run the server locally, follow these instructions:

1. Run `npm install` in a shell in this directory (make sure you have Node.js and npm installed).

2. Run `npm start`. This should start a Node.js server that loads a page on http://localhost:3000/.

3. Open two web browser windows, both at http://localhost:3000/, and place them side-by-side, to get the best viewing experience.

4. Enter an interactive Vega-Lite specification in the first text box, and click submit. Feel free to look at the directory `example_specifications/` for some pre-designed examples.

5. Interact with the visualization on one window to see cursors and other annotations appear on the other window.
